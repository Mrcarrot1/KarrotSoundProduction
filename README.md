# KarrotSoundProduction
KarrotSoundProduction is a free and open source soundboard intended for use in theater productions.
It (will have) support for playing multiple sounds at once as well as indefinitely long sound files.
Supported media types (will) include FLAC, WAV, MP3, AAC, and WMA.

This software was designed as a replacement for the now-defunct EXP Soundboard.
As such, it has full backwards compatibility with EXP's configuration files, without the reliance on outdated software.
